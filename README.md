# PosterMe - Star in Your Own Movie

PosterMe transforms any photo into a cinematic poster moment. Users upload their image and instantly recast themselves into iconic movie scenes, legendary characters, famous series artwork, or stylized fictional worlds.

The brand is fun, creative, and cinematic, built around the idea of turning anyone into the star of their own universe.
